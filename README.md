I'm not a veteran programmer, but the beginner project that helped me learn the most was trudging through the Python Docs and writing an example for every function of the standard library.

It introduced me to functions I didn't know about, and forced me to understand functions I didn't get in the first place. For every function I made a file, provided the syntax/description, and coded an example myself. I ended it all by making a very simple GUI that let me browse through the files, click on it, and view the content.

I made the program at first because I was about to depart to an area where I knew I wouldn't have internet, and thus couldn't read the Docs online. I found myself rarely having to use it because I absorbed so much of the knowledge.

Goals:

1. Build Library of Functions
2. Create GUI to browse file contents
3. Use GUI to execute file examples
